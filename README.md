# Tic Tac Toe Game and Digital Clock Project

This Java project combines the classic game of Tic Tac Toe with a digital clock feature. The Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to compete against each other, while the digital clock displays the current time. This project demonstrates basic concepts of Java programming, user input handling, game logic, and graphical user interface (GUI) implementation.

## Introduction

The **Tic Tac Toe Game and Digital Clock** project is a Java application that combines two functionalities: a two-player Tic Tac Toe game and a digital clock display. The project is designed to showcase fundamental programming concepts and provide an interactive experience for users.

## Features

- **Tic Tac Toe Game:**
  - Two players can take turns making moves on the Tic Tac Toe grid.
  - The game detects winning combinations and declares a winner.
  - If no player wins, the game ends in a draw.

- **Digital Clock:**
  - Displays the current time in a digital format.
  - The clock updates in real-time, providing an accurate representation of the current time.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Java programming concepts.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

## Usage

1. Compile and run the Java program.
2. The Tic Tac Toe game and digital clock interface will be displayed.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game and view the clock.

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell.
3. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your symbols.
4. The game ends when a player wins or the grid is filled without a winner.

## Digital Clock

The digital clock component of this project displays the current time. It automatically updates to reflect the accurate time. This feature is designed to provide additional functionality and a practical application of Java programming.
